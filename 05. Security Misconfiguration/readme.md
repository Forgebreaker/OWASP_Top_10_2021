# Bounty Boys: Security Misconfiguration

It basically means that a software application, a system, or even a server isn't set up correctly in terms of security. This can happen for several reasons, and it can make your system vulnerable to attacks. 

Think of it like keeping your house safe: you'd use strong locks, close windows you donâ€™t need, and wouldn't tell strangers about your security system's weaknesses!

What can go wrong:

  + Misconfigured security settings can lead to sensitive data being exposed or stolen. Imagine if your private documents were left out in the open for anyone to read.

  + Poor configuration might leave your system vulnerable to malware, including viruses, ransomware, or spyware. Think of it as leaving your front door unlocked and someone sneaking in to plant a bug.
