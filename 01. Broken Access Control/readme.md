# OWASP Top 1: Broken Access Control

- Imagine a website as a building with many rooms. Some rooms are open to everyone, 
  while others are locked and only certain people have the key. Access control is like the security system that decides who can enter which room.

- Broken access control happens when this security system fails.
  It's like having a faulty lock that lets unauthorized people into restricted rooms.

- What can go wrong:

  + Viewing Sensitive Information: An unauthorized person might enter a room they shouldn't be in and see private information

  + Accessing Unauthorized Functions: They might also be able to do things they shouldnâ€™t be able to do
