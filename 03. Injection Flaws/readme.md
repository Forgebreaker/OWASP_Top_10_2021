# Bounty Boys: Injection Flaws

Injection flaws is a common type of vulnerability application (Top 1 in 2017 and Top 3 in 2021)

They happen when the input provided by a user is misunderstood by the application as a command or a part of a command. Allowing attackers to manipulate the behavior of the application

What can go wrong:

  + Hacker can access, modify, or delete database information or execute any system commands.

  + With OS command injection, the worst-case scenario is when attackers manage to execute a command that gives them a backdoor into the server. Once attackers have gained a foothold on your web server through command injection, they can start snooping around, exploring your systems, and looking for other ways to hop from one system to another.
