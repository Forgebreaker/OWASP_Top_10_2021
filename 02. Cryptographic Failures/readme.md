# OWASP Top 2: Cryptographic Failures

- Imagine you have a secret message that you want to send to a friend in a room full of people. You don't want anyone else to hear it, so you use a secret code that only you and your friend know. Cryptography is like that secret code. It scrambles your data so that only the right person can understand it.

- Cryptographic failures happen when there are mistakes in how the secret code is used. It's like if you used a code that was too easy to guess or accidentally gave the key to the code to someone else

- What can go wrong:

  + When you send your secret message (like an email), you want to make sure that nobody can intercept it while it's traveling from you to your friend. If it's not well protected, someone could grab it and read it.

  + Once your message reaches your friend, they might keep it in a box (like an email server). You also want this box to be locked so that only your friend can open it, not even the person who owns the box.
