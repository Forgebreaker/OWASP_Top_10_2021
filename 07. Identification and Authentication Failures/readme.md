# Bounty Boys: Identification and Authentication Failure

Think of identification as telling someone who you are. It's like saying, "Hi, I'm Thinh Tran." In the digital world, identification often comes in the form of a username or an email address. It's just a way of introducing yourself to a system, like a website or an app.

Authentication is the process of proving you are who you say you are. Imagine you say, "I'm Thinh," and someone asks, "Can you prove it?" In real life, you might show an ID card. In the digital world, this is usually done through a password, a fingerprint, a security token, or even a face scan.

Authentication failure is important for security. It's like a guard that makes sure only the right people can enter a secure area. If anyone could just say they're Thinh and get access, that would be a huge security risk. Authentication makes sure that only the real Thinh (or the real user) gets access to sensitive information or controls.

What can go wrong:

  + Weaknesses in the system's security can allow hackers to bypass authentication mechanisms. Poor security measures might lead to leaked user data, compromising the authentication process.

  + Complex or poorly designed authentication processes can frustrate users and lead to errors. Glitches, bugs, or downtime in the system can prevent successful authentication.
