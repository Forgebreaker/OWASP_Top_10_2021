# Bounty Boys: Insecure Design

Think of building an app like building a house. If the blueprint of the house (which is the plan or design) has some flaws, like it doesn't consider strong winds or earthquakes, the house might face serious problems later, no matter how good the bricks and beams are.

Similarly, in app development, if the initial plan or architecture of the app doesn't consider security threats, the app will have vulnerabilities. These aren't mistakes made while writing the code or setting it up; they're issues because the initial plan didn't account for certain risks.

What can go wrong:

  + If the design doesn't adequately secure data, hackers might access sensitive information like personal details, credit card numbers, or health records. This can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and legal issues

  + Flaws in design might allow unauthorized users to gain access to parts of the system they shouldnâ€™t be able to, leading to misuse or damage.
