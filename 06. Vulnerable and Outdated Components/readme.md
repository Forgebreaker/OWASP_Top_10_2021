# Bounty Boys: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Imagine your application uses an old version of a web framework. Hackers know about a vulnerability in this version that allows them to send specially crafted requests to your server, gaining unauthorized access or even stealing sensitive data.

What can go wrong:

  + Outdated components often have known vulnerabilities that are documented and can be easily exploited. One vulnerable component can compromise the entire application, as attackers can use it as a gateway to launch further attacks.

  + Modern applications often rely on a complex chain of dependencies. One vulnerable component in this chain can have a cascading effect, leading to multiple failures or vulnerabilities in the system.
