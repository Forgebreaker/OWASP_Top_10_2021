# Bounty Boys: OWASP Top 10 (2021)

In this module, we explore the essentials of web pentesting, focusing on the classic OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Through the labs I built, you'll gain hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting these vulnerabilities, with detailed documentation provided for each lab. By the end, you'll emerge equipped with the skills to assess and mitigate web application security risks effectively and be able to re-create many vulnerabilities.
