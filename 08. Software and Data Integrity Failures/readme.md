# Bounty Boys: Software and Data Integrity Failures

Software and Data Integrity Failures refer to issues that occur when software and data are not accurately maintained, transmitted, or stored. This can lead to incorrect data, unexpected software behavior, and security vulnerabilities.

Imagine a small tech startup quickly builds a web application to meet market demand. To speed up development, they use several third-party libraries without thoroughly vetting them. One of these libraries, downloaded from an untrusted source, contains malicious code.

The malicious code in the library creates a backdoor in the application, allowing attackers to steal sensitive user data. This leads to a data breach, damaging the company's reputation and incurring legal liabilities.

What can go wrong:

  + If the integrity of software or libraries is compromised, it could lead to the execution of malicious code. This can give attackers control over the system or allow them to perform unauthorized actions.

  + In a software supply chain attack, if one component is compromised, it can affect all other components that depend on it, leading to widespread vulnerabilities.
