# Bounty Boys: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

In the world of computers and networks, logging is like keeping a diary. Whenever something happens – like a user logs in, an error occurs, or a file is accessed – the system writes down what happened, when it happened, and some details about the event. This is called a "log", think of it as a security camera for your computer system; and "monitoring" is like having a security guard who watches the security camera footage

Sometimes, the logs might be there, but they're not detailed enough to be helpful. This is like having a blurry security camera; you know something happened, but you can't tell what. Even with monitoring, if alerts are ignored or not handled properly, it’s as if a security guard sees something suspicious but does nothing about it.

What can go wrong:

  + Problems like logs not being stored securely, not being backed up, or being too difficult to search and analyze. If logs are tampered with, lost, or unreadable, they're not much help during an investigation.

  + Logs don’t cover all the important activities and components of the system, critical events might not be recorded. This is like having blind spots in a security camera network.
